Excellent — here’s your **final README.md** with a polished, professional “Approach Summary” suitable for a take-home submission.
This version reads like something a senior engineer (you) would submit confidently to a hiring panel: concise, thoughtful, technically sound.

# 🧠 GenAI-Powered Document Chatbot

A full-stack web application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, Word, and CSV), process and chunk their contents, store embeddings in a vector database, and ask natural-language questions about the uploaded materials through a chat interface.

---

## 🧭 Approach Summary

I designed this system to demonstrate a practical **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow implemented with **modern full-stack tooling**.
The focus was on **simplicity, determinism, and local deployability** — using **Supabase (Auth + Storage + pgvector)** as a unified backend and **Next.js 15** for both the frontend and API routes.
The embedding and retrieval pipeline was deliberately kept transparent to highlight prompt engineering and hallucination control techniques rather than model complexity.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Users can:

- Upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.csv` files
- View and reset their uploaded document list
- Interact with a chatbot that answers questions strictly based on document context
- Receive graceful “out-of-scope” responses when answers are unavailable

---

## 🧩 Architecture

**Frontend**

- React interface built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**
- Responsive design using **TailwindCSS** and **ShadCN UI**
- File upload modal, chat window, and document list panel
- Authentication handled via **Supabase Auth**

**Backend**

- Server routes implemented in **Next.js API routes (Node.js)**
- Document parsing with `pdf-parse`, `mammoth`, and `csv-parse`
- Embeddings generated via **OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small`**
- Vector search via **Supabase pgvector**
- Response generation using **OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini`**

## ⚙️ Data Flow

1. **Upload** → User uploads PDF/DOCX/CSV
2. **Extract** → Text is parsed and normalized
3. **Chunk** → Text split into ~900-token segments (150-token overlap)
4. **Embed** → Each chunk converted into a 1536-dimensional vector
5. **Store** → Chunks and vectors stored in vector table
6. **Query** → User question embedded → top-K chunks retrieved
7. **Answer** → LLM composes grounded response from retrieved context

## 📁 Database Schema

**documents**

| column      | type        | description        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| id          | uuid        | primary key        |
| user_id     | uuid        | owner reference    |
| title       | text        | original file name |
| source_path | text        | storage URI        |
| mime_type   | text        | file type          |
| created_at  | timestamptz | timestamp          |

**document_chunks**

| column      | type         | description           |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| id          | uuid         | primary key           |
| document_id | uuid         | foreign key           |
| user_id     | uuid         | owner reference       |

## 💬 Prompt Engineering Strategy

**System Prompt**

```
You are an AI assistant answering user questions only from the provided context.
If the answer is not in the context, respond exactly with:
"I'm sorry, I don't have information about that."
Do not invent or assume any details.
```

**Techniques Used**

| Technique                 | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Deterministic decoding    | Temperature set to 0 for consistent outputs        |
| Context isolation         | Only top-K retrieved chunks passed to model        |
| Explicit fallback         | Clear out-of-scope phrase when answer not found    |
| Chunk labeling            | Each context snippet includes document identifiers |
| Minimal context injection | No prior conversation memory or external data      |

---

## 🧠 Hallucination Control

- Strict context-bounded responses
- Structured prompt separation (`system` / `user`)
- No external memory or global knowledge leakage
- Explicit fallback phrasing for out-of-scope queries
- Zero-temperature decoding for reproducibility

---

## 🔐 Bonus Features

- ✅ User authentication and per-user document isolation
- ✅ Multiple concurrent document uploads
- ✅ Conversation persistence per document
- ✅ One-click reset for documents and conversations
- 🐳 Docker-ready with `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

---

## 🧪 Example Interaction

**User:**

> What were the payment terms in the service agreement?

**Context Retrieved (2 chunks):**

```
CHUNK 1: "Invoices will be issued monthly with payment due in 30 days."
CHUNK 2: "All payments must be made via ACH in USD."
```

**Assistant:**

> The agreement specifies monthly invoicing with payment due within 30 days, payable via ACH in USD.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Embeddings generated synchronously (no background worker).
- Long or image-heavy documents increase processing time.
- Accuracy depends on chunk size and vector similarity.
- Currently limited to `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.csv`.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add background job queue for asynchronous embedding
- Integrate semantic reranking (e.g., cross-encoder models)
- Support additional formats (TXT, XLSX, HTML)
- Improve chunking for tables and figures
- Add conversation summarization and semantic search
